Hello Everyone,

The Group Mediclaim Insurance Policy aims to provide Medical assistance to employees and their immediate families for their medical expenses. It offers coverage for –
	->Maternity (generally not a part of Personal Mediclaim Policy)
	->Planned Surgery
	->Pre-Existing Diseases
And benefits such as faster claim assistance, higher claim settlement ratio and many more.

During the current financial year, many of us have claimed and received benefits through the existing Group Medical Insurance policy of the company. Throughout the year, many employees have interacted with us to share their experiences. Amidst this process, we learnt that many of our employees already have Personal Mediclaim Policy available with them or are covered under the policy of their spouse; and they do not wish to take any benefit of the company Group Insurance Policy. We, as a company, however still spend a huge amount on the Insurance Premium for all the employees but many of us choose to use a preferred insurance partner outside of the office policy. Looking at the scenario for the past few years, we have decided to make the Insurance Policy optional for all, wherein employees can decide whether to opt in or out for the Group Medical Insurance Policy of the company.  

Stated below are some guidelines that shall help the employees make the best decision for themselves -

	->Employees can voluntarily choose company’s Group Insurance Policy.
	->Group Insurance Partner will be decided by the company.
	->Insurance Period for New Group Medical Policy shall be 1st April, 2023 to 31st March, 2024.
	->Group Medical Insurance Policy of the company covers the employee himself/ herself, spouse and up to 2 children only. The company would consider all the 	details in HRMS record as default.
	
	->Sum Covered –
		->Executives – 2 Lacs
		->Sr. Executives & Below Manager – 3 Lacs
		->Manager & Above – 5 Lacs
	->Company will be paying the entire Mediclaim sum for all the employees in the beginning of the year, only a small token amount (small percentage of the actual 	premium) will be deducted from the CTC every month as per the below table -
		->Executive Level – 200 INR a month, Sum assured - 2 Lacs
		->Sr. Executive & below Manager Level – 250 INR a month, Sum assured - 3 Lacs
		->Manager & Above Level – 300 INR a month, Sum assured - 5 Lacs.
 

->This cost is hardly a fraction of the total Mediclaim Premium if purchased directly
->New joiners in the company shall also get the same option.
->If employee decides to quit, then he/ she won’t be eligible to claim Group Medical insurance after the exit date.
->Please note that once you opt in for the insurance, you cannot opt out till the end of the policy period which is normally one year (April 2023 – March 2024).
->In the same way, if you opt out, you will not get an opportunity to opt in till the new policy period starts next year (April 2024).
->Employees can have additions to the group policy (adding a spouse/ baby) in between the defined policy period, if they have already opted for group insurance.

This policy aims to provide the best to the employees who wish to take the benefit of the Group Insurance Policy. We understand that you might have a lot of questions and concerns regarding this. Hereby, we have an Open Discussion/ Q&A session on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, 10 AM.
